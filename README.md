# Vehicle Detection Project

#### By: [Eqbal Eki](http://www.eqbalq.com/)

****
This project goal is to write a software pipeline to detect vehicles in a video.  This is a project for 
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive).

###Steps:

1 Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
2 Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
3 Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.
4 Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
5 Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
6 Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.
